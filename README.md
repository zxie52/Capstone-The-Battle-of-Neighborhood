# Capstone-The-Battle-of-Neighborhood

# The final project for the IBM capstone course 

# Main Questions:

  It is well known that New York City is the center of east coast and food there is really good. As a Asian student nearby, I really like to take bus to Chinatown for a good meal on weekend. At this time, I want to use the knowledge I learned here to solve the following questions:
 
 •  What is the best location to enjoy Aisan food in NYC? 
 
 •  Is it a good idea to open a Asian restaurant in NYC now?
  
# Methodology

• Data will be collected from https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset and cleaned and processed into a dataframe. (this dataset is quite easy to be accessed)

• FourSquare be used to locate all venues and then filtered by Asian restaurants. Ratings, tips, and likes by users will be counted and added to the dataframe.

• Data will be sorted based on rankings and be visually assessed by using graphing from Python libraries.
